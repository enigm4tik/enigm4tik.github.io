## It is oC++tober

Man, has it been a while since I have written something here. 
It is October and there are a lot of challenges going on, so I decided to give myself one as well.  
I have recently started learning C++ properly and will use this blog to document my journey a bit.  
Previously, as in learning every other language I know, I learned the languages by doing: creating a project and solving problems as they occur. 
This time, I want to learn it properly as I've noticed C++ is a lot stricter than the languages I've used before.  
Understanding the underlying concepts really helps a lot with understanding and using the language!

### Day 1
So for day 1 of oC++tober, I'll start with a simple hello world program! 

```cpp
#include <iostream>

void main()
{
    std::cout << "Hello World!" << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

See you tomorrow :D

```cpp
string greeting = "enigm4tik";
```
