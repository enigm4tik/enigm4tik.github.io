## "My Advent of Code Story"

### What is Advent of Code?
> [Advent of Code](www.adventofcode.com) is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, a speed contest, or to challenge each other.


When I heard of Advent of Code for the first time in 2020 I was too intimidated to even try to participate.  
If I remember correctly, I solved exactly one of the puzzles and the second one was already too difficult to even attempt.

### 2021

In 2021 I wanted to try it - this time for real. I was still struggling with a lot of the puzzles but I got to day 11, had to skip day 12 and continued with 13 and 14.  
> What was Day 12? 

you may ask.  
Basically, it was a simple application of graph theory. Since I am self-taught (in all the languages I know) I only ever touched what I needed to know to solve a problem.  
Looks like I never needed to know about graphs, their theory and their algorithms.  
That year I declared [Dijkstra's Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm) my _arch nemesis_. I just couldn't wrap my head around it.  
**Spoiler**: I actually figured it out, just a year later - in time for the next Advent of Code. 

Long story short, when I realized that I am still missing a lot of theory, algorithms and knick-knacks to solve that year, I went back all the way to 2015 - the first Advent of Code.  
I tried really hard to come up with solutions and not to look up other people's code to figure everything out _on my own_.  
This, naturally, led me to use old pattern and skip everything I didn't know (theory-wise) or was unable to solve.  
However, since I solved so many of them (136 *) across 5 years, I learned a lot and was (_at least theoretically_) prepared for 2022.  
```
When applying to university, one of the people who interviewed me was impressed 
with my participation in Advent of Code over the years 
and wished me luck for this year.
```

### 2022
This year, however, I was too busy (with university and work) to properly participate.  
I did learn a few things though ... I think for the first time I actually understood BFS!  
My goal for next year (if I have the time) or the following one (if not) is to boldly try to understand the puzzles I have skipped, take a deeper look into the ones I solved (is there a better way to do it? more efficient? faster?) and learn a **lot**!  
Other people are **amazing** and I hope to learn how they solved the problems I'm struggling with!  


I'm going to document my findings in this blog to create a knowledge base that I can use to look up problems when I am working on puzzles again in the future.
