## The various keywords

Today was a pretty busy day so I only got to go over one video, talking about the keyword `this`.  
I have seen and used this already in javaScript, so the usage was not completely new! (lucky me)
Since, I don't have a lot of time, I'll just list some of the keywords I've already seen.

### Day 3

```cpp
new
this
const 
private
public
bool
break
continue
class
struct
true 
false
unsigned
void
mutable
protected
virtual
while
do
not
using
for
if
else
```

See you tomorrow!

```cpp
string greeting = "enigm4tik";
```
