This is a quick update to announce that I figured out how to manipulate the CSS of the blog.  
I went over 3 different iterations and I realized that finding the best color combination is not an easy task.  
I really like the green accents that were based on my 🐸 emoji!  

I cannot, for the life of me, figure out how to remove all posts from the index page 
and only show the last one and `x` amount of blog entries with a short preview...
Jekyll is pretty powerful but confusing to me 😔

I'll figure it out eventually!
